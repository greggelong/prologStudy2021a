Turbo prolog with dosbox

alt enter -- will switch from full screen to small

turbo prolog is located at c:\prolog

open dosbox

according to the directions that you can find in dosbox with the command 'intro mount'

you type

'mount c c:\prolog\'  which will create a 'virtual' c drive with prolog as its  contents

then type c:  and dir and you can see the contents 

then type prolog.exe to run


I got the prolog exe from this tutorial

I need to change the stack amount in options on the turbo-prolog editor if I had a lot of recursion

for the cauliflower fractal at level 10 I set it to 4000 paragraphs
